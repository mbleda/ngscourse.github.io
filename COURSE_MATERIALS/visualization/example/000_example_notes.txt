1. Go to the location box and insert ''chr11:996096-1036047'' in the search box and hit ``Go``.
2. Move acroos the alignment
3. Zoom in
4. Grey boxes are reads:
      - point to the left --> map reverse strand
      - point to the right --> map forward strand
5. At the top --> histogram of coverage
6. Zoom further
      - Color representation of the sequence
      - Zoom in --> Bases are shown
      - Amminoacids corresponding to each base
      - See all possible translation reading frames
7. Change read information panels
      
What we want to do with IGV?

1. Examine coverage
      - High/low coverage
      - No coverage
2. Visualize alternative splicing
      - RNA alignment against DNA, not cDNA
3. Look for base changes -- > SNPs
      - Complete grey reads --> no mismatches
      - Coloured bases --> Change
	    - Coverage track os only coloured if >20% of the reads support the variant
      - Reads are shadowed acording to quality
	    - Darker --> good quality
	    - Ligther --> bad quality
      - Bases are also shadowed acording to quality
	    - Darker --> good quality
	    - Ligther --> bad quality
      - Inspecting a SNP (chr11:1,018,335-1,018,412)
	    - Look at the coverage bar --> percentage and counts
	    - Sort alignment by base
      - Inspecting a homozigous variant (chr11:1,019,336-1,019,413)
            - All reads support the variant but 1
            - The reference read quality is 0
            
4. Load SNP data
      - File > Load from server > Annotations > Variantion and repeats > dbSNP 1.3.7
            
RNA-Seq Alignment
====================================
- Main difference: Presence of introns. Part of a read is on either side of the intron
- Compare regions with coverage in a tissue and no coverage in the other tissue
    - Isoform observed in one tissue, not the other
